# 🚀 Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3 (51 C++ Problems)

This repository contains my solutions for **51 programming problems** from the *Algorithms and Problem Solving – Level 3* course.  
All problems are implemented in **C++** with clean, modular code and detailed documentation.

- Each file includes:
  - **Problem description** (as comments at the top)
  - **C++ solution**
  - **Documentation** using `@brief`, `@param`, and `@return`

## ✅ Topics Covered

- 🗂️ File handling (read/write, update, delete)
- 🧩 Structs and vectors
- 🔠 String manipulation
- 🔍 Searching and sorting
- 🖥️ Menu-driven programs

  📖 Learning Goals

- By solving these problems, I have improved in:

 - Writing modular and maintainable C++ code
 - Applying algorithms and problem-solving techniques
 - Using file handling for persistent storage
 - Practicing real-world use cases with small projects
